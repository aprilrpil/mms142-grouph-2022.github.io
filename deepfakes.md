### What are deepfakes?

When deepfakes become widely used, it could allow non-celebrity actors to be hired into a role, resulting in unemployment or a change in how the entertainment industry selects their talent for productions. (Lalla et al., 2022) 
Deepfake is an artificial intelligence-based method that is used to create realistic-looking human features or sounds that are superimposed on another individual’s body to produce photos and videos. According to Panyatham (2020), in September 2019, there are over 14 thousand deepfake videos that circulated online and it is commonly used in film production such as multiple language dubbing. It can be possible that deepfakes can disrupt how we view the entertainment industry. 


### How do deepfakes disrupt the entertainment industry? 

__Subtitles__ 

Subtitles are captions that translates the video dialogue into another language for the viewer to understand. However, deepfake can be an effective alternative to subtitles because this type of AI can copy lip movements that will match the translated dialogue and superimpose it to an actor’s head. According to Vincent (2021), using deepfake dubs allows companies to save a lot of time and money because they are “cheap and quick to create” while retaining the performance and style of the acting. Although this can benefit the viewers from different parts of the world,  Usukhbayar (2020) states that subtitles are also impossible to completely eliminate because they will always be required for those who have hearing impairments.
