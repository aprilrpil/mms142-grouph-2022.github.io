## What is Disruptive Technology?

<img class="img2" source:"netflix-streaming.jpg">
Disruptive technology are innovations originating from low-end or new-market foothold that are capable of disrupting existing markets and value networks (McKelvey, 2020). According to Smith, disruptive technology overtakes systems, habits, or even fellow innovations as it is more superior and convenient. It may also change how consumers, industries, or businesses work (2022). A common example of disruptive technology is Netflix and streaming services overtaking DVD-renting services as films are digitized for the audience’s consumption (Zaman, 2022).
