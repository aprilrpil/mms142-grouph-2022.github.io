Disruptive technology are innovations originating from low-end or new-market foothold that are capable of disrupting existing markets and value networks (McKelvey, 2020). According to Smith(2022), disruptive technology overtakes systems, habits, or even fellow innovations as it is more superior and convenient. It may also change how consumers, industries, or businesses work . A common example of disruptive technology is Netflix and streaming services overtaking DVD-renting services as films are digitized for the audience’s consumption (Zaman, 2022).

Technological advancement made it convenient to deliver messages in different areas of communication. It also plays a huge role in the development of Disruptive Technologies. An innovation originating from the low-end or new market foothold that are capable of affecting the existing markets and value networks (Harvard Business Review, 2015). Usually, this is a result of adaptation and modernization. One example of a Disruptive Technology is called Deepfake, a combination of the words “deep learning” and “fake”.
