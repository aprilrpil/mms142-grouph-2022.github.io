### DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY

- Innovations originating from low-end or new-market foothold that are capable of disrupting existing markets and value networks (McKelvey, 2020).
  
- A common example of disruptive technology is Netflix and streaming services overtaking DVD-renting services as films are digitized for the audience’s consumption (Zaman, 2022).
  
### WHAT IS DEEPFAKE

- Artificial Intelligence capable of manipulating media by swapping facial and voice recognition to a desired existing persona that is commonly well-known such as celebrities, politicians, influencers, and athletes.
  
#### FIELDS DISRUPTED BY DEEPFAKE

**Financial and Insurance Markets**
      
- Although unlikely to occur, it is possible that deepfake may cause immense amounts of distrusts between the bank and their client which may lead to a bank run. Indeed, Borak (2020) highlights the incident where scammers stole huge monetary assets from the CEO of a UK-based energy firm by deceiving him by using AI-based software to change their voice identically to the head of the CEO’s German parent company.
            
**Media and Entertainment Industry**
    
- Deepfake is also infamous for generating nonconsensual pornography. According to Adee (2020), 96% of deepfake pornography released on the internet targets celebrities, especially women. Indeed, Maine Mendoza fell victim to the unsolicited use of her facial recognition in a sex video that circulated online (Philstar Life, 2020). Although many believed that she did not partake in that pornography, this may cause unwanted and harmful issues to other actors, especially their rights, and security.
     
**Government**

- A deepfake video of Ukrainian President declaring the nation’s soldiers to surrender and lay down their weapons was released by hackers who may be russians spreading disinformation as warfare tactic (Alynn, 2022). Although Ukraine was quick to address this concern and people easily spotted some evidence that the video clip was deepfake and untrue, the advances in AI and technology may blur the line between reality and illusion, making deepfake a scarier weapon to create distrust among people and their leaders.
