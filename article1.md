How do deepfakes disrupt these markets/industries?

Financial market

Deep Fakes are now being used by criminals for purposes including fraud, blackmail, and other unethical financial schemes. It is possible for criminals to distribute a face-swap video that falsely depicts a CEO making damaging private comments. This would result in a decrease in the stock price of the CEO's company, which would allow the criminals to profit from short sales (Bateman, 2020).

Fraudsters can, for instance, pose as your company's CEO or an employee of the bank in order to obtain personal information, force you to transfer money, or open a bank account in order to launder money (ING Wholesale Banking, n.d.).

Fraudsters also have the ability to use deepfakes to file insurance claims or other claims on behalf of deceased individuals. Claims can be successfully made on pensions, life insurance, and benefits for a deceased person for many years after the person's death. Deep Fakes are utilized in this scenario in order to successfully trick the bank into believing that one of their customers is still alive (Kurup, 2022).

According to Borak (2020), as the use of facial recognition technology grows, people in China are becoming increasingly concerned about the possibility of deep fakes and biometric data leaks. 

Brewster (2021) quotes Jake Moore, a former police officer and current cybersecurity expert at security firm ESET, who says that while audio and visual deep fakes are fascinating examples of 21st century technological advancement, they also pose a significant threat to people's personal information, money, and commercial enterprises.

Gaming industry

When impressive natural language generation models such as GPT3 are combined with gaming deepfakes, this will result in NPCs having the limitless ability to converse with your avatar using convincing synchronized face and mouth movements without the need to follow specific scripts. This will allow for a much more immersive gaming experience. Moreover, the so-called "voice skins'' are making it possible for LGBT+ players to alter their in-game voices, which has led to a more enjoyable gaming experience. (Lalla et al., 2022)

Machine Learning

Using deepfake for creating malicious content can give users the wrong idea on how to use these innovations (Buzz Blog Box, 2020). It ultimately tarnishes the field of AI and what it can offer from a consumer's perspective.

Entertainment Industry
Deepfake has been used to swap the faces of celebrities into obscene images or videos online. This could negatively impact their reputation and brand as a whole (Buzz Blog Box, 2020).
