## Deepfake Detection
 
According to a survey conducted in 2021, spotting a deepfake appears less a matter of motivation and attention but rather inability. People clearly overestimate their capability to discern a deepfake video as those whom exhibited more confidence were evidently more inaccurate. Despite the respondents' prior awareness of the incentivized experiment, extrinsic motivation proved incapable of increasing accuracy. In practice, previously established methods to discern digital information were deemed ineffective when confronted by deepfake videos. Without the technical tools to supplement our inability to detect deepfake videos, these results are an alarming proof of vulnerability.
 
### Digital Marketing
 
Deepfake technology provides an opportunity for smaller businesses to produce low-cost advertisements to promote their products and/or services. Marketers can easily repurpose their content for other clients. This essentially reduces expenses and eliminate the potential need to reshoot and recast actors and/actresses. Semi-artificial or fully artificial videos make editing much more efficient as one has either more degree of control over the assets.
 
### Art

Another nuanced application challenges how we perceive and define death through digital resurrection. In St. Petersburg, Florida, the Dalí Museum houses a digital exhibition of the late Dali Salvador. The exhibition itself houses a life-sized digital interactive recreation of Dalí whom responds with varying actions ranging from greetings to. By face swapping a footage of an actor with similar physique and voice acting, the collaborative efforts of Goodby Silverstein & Partners (GS&P) were able to produce 45 minutes' worth of video content from a countless resource of archived materials ranging from images, interviews, and footages.
