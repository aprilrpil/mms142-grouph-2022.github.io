title: How Do Deep Fakes Work?
---
<h2> How do Deep Fakes work? <h2>

<p> Modern knowledge of deepfake as a trend, started in a reddit forum that featured faceswaps 
of actors in pornographic materials back in late 2017 (Somers, 2020). 
The word “deepfake” is coined from merging the words “deep learning” and “fake” (Brandon, 2018). 
Its mainstream original use was applied to public personalities that have many digital image materials 
available to train in order to develop a fake video or photo overlay of the same person 
into an existing piece of media product, completely out of context. 
</p>

<p> According to Batir (2021), the most basic algorithm used by deep fake AIs is called Deep Autoencoder, 
which has two components. The first component is the 
      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">encoder</span>, 
    which tracks the primary facial structure of the overlay image to identify 
    its fundamental facial feature, allowing the second component, the 
      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">decoder</span>, to align 
    the superimposed faces together and reconstruct the original image’s face 
    over the overlay face to make it have the original image’s body. 
 </p>
 
 <p> Despite the recent emergence of deep fake as a technology, its origins actually 
 go back to as early as the 1990s, under the Video Rewrite program which advanced the 
 technology of face recognition and swapping, though quite apparent with its syntheticity.
 </p>
 
 <p> The general workflow of creating deepfakes is shared in a blog on Inspired eLearning (2022), 
 entitled “The Biggest Trends in Deepfake Detection in 2022”. It includes:
 
 <ul>
  <li>Gathering reference images or footage;</li>
  <li>Aligning facial structure of the source object to its target object;</li>
  <li>Using the deep learning algorithm to train from the source material and original target material;</li>
  <li>Converting data into superimposed images; and</li>
  <li>Exporting as a finished deep fake product.</li>
 </ul>
 
 While this sounds fairly simple, the time it takes to train source material of the 
 face the AI user wants to swap into a clip may take days to achieve, requiring footage 
 worth countless hours, with varying angles and emotions from the facial data set.
 </p>
 
<h2> Why is Deepfake Considered Disruptive Technology? <h2>
 
<p> In the recent hike of social media users due to the shift of the larger population 
online amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the popularity of deepfakes has now scattered throughout cyberspace. 
In its initial branding of being used as a malicious technology, many communities have found 
the concept of face swapping media products to be rather useful. Since then, deepfake technology has 
reached areas of voice manipulation and still image generation of realistic faces that do not exist in 
the physical world, and even superimposing bodies onto a person’s body data set (Somers, 2020). 
This eventually led to the preference of calling deep fakes as a more neutral locution, “AI-generated synthetic media”.
</p>

<p> Because deepfake is now a proliferated technological service online, it creates 
an entirely new pool of target consumers. Theoretically, deepfake-generated visual 
effects take less financial investment and labor resources as opposed to a full 
audio-visual production. It is, essentially, categorized as disruptive innovation due 
to its completely new method multimedia generation. Christensen (n.d.) defines disruptive 
innovation as a streamline product or service which appeals to divergent consumers from the 
usual demographical pool. As a disruptor of the sustained film industry, it diminishes the high-cost 
timebound nature of traditional film sets. Thus, deepfake technology caters to more independent 
low-budget producers who require audio-visual material that is generated at a faster pace.
</p>

<p> As of 2022, deepfake users appear in many platforms, each with varying background and selected 
media niche. For more flexible and complex AI-generated material, deepfake software such as 
DeepFace Labs, Faceswap, First Order Model, and 
   <a href=https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip> Wav2Lip </a>, 
a GitHub library that allows manipulation 
of images and footages into lip-syncing a .wav file (Sandusky, 2021). Softwares such as these require 
moderate knowledge on programming languages such as Python and a dedicated graphics card due to machine 
learning interfaces a user will need to interact with (Sandusky, 2021). </p>

<p> Meanwhile, there are also smartphone applications such as FaceApp, 
Face Swap Live, and many others that have already surfaced and are available 
for free access to its supported user devices. This means that there are both 
lightweight and expert platforms available for users ranging from hobbyists to professional producers.
</p>

<p> This is also the reason why we see many content creators and regular social media users 
have the chance to operate deepfake technologies. Subsequently, the increase of people that have 
access to relatively professional tools in the modern age, will create a separate user market that 
relies heavily on the convenience and subcultural content that deepfake is able to project.
</p>

<h2> Disrupted Markets <h2>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">[As a contrasting view to the apparent markets that deepfakes disrupt]</span></p>

<p>In the case of multimedia producers that have been incorporating deepfakes and slowly integrating it into 
their whole media production process, deepfakes may appear as a relatively sustaining service that caters towards 
large production firms, which can simultaneously use manpower and AI-generated deepfakes as a hybrid system. 
At the fundamental level of using deepfakes, a human operator is still required to train the images of the whole footage.
</p>

<p>The current status of a deepfake software’s capacity is still below the finetuning capabilities that actual 
CGI artists fulfill when post-processing a production. There are obvious details on deepfaked images that would 
point out its syntheticity as opposed to actual live footage such as overly defined details or unrealistically 
smooth skins, confusing lighting, flimsy superimposition of facial hair, and disproportionate mouth or lips to 
the rest of the face. Without a ‘cleaning process’ made by professionals, the experience of watching deepfake would 
be extremely obvious to those who know how to spot it (“The Biggest Trends in Deepfake…”, 2022). The same goes for 
voice deepfakes, where some inconsistencies can be heard. In its current form, it simply cannot outperform human skills.
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the growing trend of deepfake usage continues, which means that deepfake technologies will continue 
to improve as user continue to feed the machine a large array of materials to learn and train from. That is to say 
that although its present state requires human assistance to be made hyperrealistic, it may, in the future, with the 
adequate amount of training resources and algorithmic development, completely function autonomously without human intervention.
